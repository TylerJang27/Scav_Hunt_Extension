### Configuration

Upon installing the Chrome Extension, click on the Scavenger Hunt icon to begin. There, you will have the option to change the JSON source for the scavenger hunt. You can specify the sample hunt, JSON from a URL ([example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TylerJang27/Scav_Hunt_Extension/master/res/hunt.json)), or upload JSON directly. Click submit, and the hunt will begin!

When you finish a hunt, make sure to hit Reset Hunt in order to stop getting popups.

### Hunting

When the hunt begins, you will be directed to the hunt start page. From there, follow the clues! When you navigate to a page that contains a clue, a popup alert will appear and the extension icon will display a blue "1". Click on it to retrieve the clue! Depending on the clue type, you will either receive the next clue or have the option to answer a question. Note that you must wait for the page to load completely before you can click on the extension (_on YouTube in particular this may require a refresh_).

### Encryption

The encryption used in the hunts is not cryptographically secure. It is mainly meant as a layer of obfuscation to prevent the user from reading the contents directly (or reading from Chrome storage). However, only hunts with `encrypted: false` can be reuploaded as drafts.
