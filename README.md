### Configuration

Upon installing the Chrome Extension, right click on the extension icon (top right) and open up Options. There, you will have the option to change the JSON source for the scavenger hunt. You can specify the sample JSON, JSON from a URL ([example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TylerJang27/Scav_Hunt_Extension/master/res/hunt.json)), or upload JSON directly. Click submit, and the source will be configured!

### Hunting

<!-- TODO: TYLER GENERATE STARTER HUNTS -->
<!-- TODO: TYLER GENERATE PLUGIN SUPPORT -->

Navigate to the start of the hunt (contact the hunt creator for the start if a prompt does not appear, the default is `google.com`). When you navigate to a page that contains a clue for the first time, a popup alert will appear and the extension icon will display a blue "1". Click on it to retrieve the clue! Depending on the clue type, you will either receive the next clue or have the option to submit a key. Note that you must wait for the page to load completely before you can click on the extension.

### Customization and Development

To make your own scavenger hunt:

- Install the Extension,
- Navigate to the Extension's Options,
- Click on `Generate Hunt` to open a form and create a hunt.

To add more customization:

### Clues

The following key-value pairs are expected as part of clue objects.

- id (Integer) [1]
  - The step of the clue. 0 denotes the starting point
- url (String/Regex) [1]
  - The URL Regex where the clue should be found. Do NOT inclue the https://
- text (String) [1 or html]
  - The text of the clue leading to the next step. Favored over HTML. Can use `\n`
- html (String) [1 or text]
  - An HTML file containing a clue. If specified and no text, interact will default to "always"
- image (String)
  - A path to an image (local or on web) to be displayed with the clue if text is present
- alt (String)
  - Alternative text to accompany an image if present
- interact (String) [2=always]
  - always: The clue will always be viewable as long as the user is at the correct URL
  - submit: The clue will require a user-submitted key in order to unlock

- prompt (String) [2=Enter key:]
  - A prompt for what the user should enter in the key box
- key (String) [1 if interact]
  - If interact is submit, a key to match (ignoring case) to view the next clue for a specified URL

### Encryption

Low-level base64 encryption is made available in order to prevent a curious user from poking the json. Note that a motivated user could still easily determine the json's contents. To generate the expected json, see the Chrome Extension options, where you will be able to fill out a [form](encode.html) and create it. You should indicate in the json whether or not encryption is enabled at the encryption key.
